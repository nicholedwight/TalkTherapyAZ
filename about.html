                <h1>About Robert</h1>
                <p>
                    Hi, I am Robert Preston, MA, NCC a Licensed Associate Counselor (LAC) in Arizona, often also referred to as a Mental Health Therapist. I own and operate Talk Therapy AZ PLLC. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a 20+ year career in Human Resources I made a career change to support clients with adjustment, depression, anxiety, trauma, substance use disorder, intimacy, LGBTQ+, or occupational stressors. A niche focus of my practice is supporting clients who are struggling with anxiety or trauma from personal injury accidents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are the author of your story. I hope during our time together you feel brave, respected, and welcome to explore all your life experiences. 
                </p>
                <h2>What makes me legit?</h2>
                <p>
                    Education has been a lifelong passion. I earned a bachelor's degree at Johnson & Wales University, an MBA master’s degree at Western International University, a master’s degree in Professional Mental Health Counseling with a concentration in addictions at Lewis and Clark College a Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) program in Portland, Oregon and recently was accepted into the Psy.D. program for Clinical Psychology at Northern Arizona University – Phoenix Campus (Fall, 2021). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a Licensed Associate Counselor (LAC) through the Arizona Board of Behavioral Supervisors. Additionally, I am certified through the Mental Health and Addiction Board of Oregon (MHACBO) as a Certified Drug and Alcohol Counselor (CADC-I). Lastly, in January of 2021 I received certification from the National Board of Certified Counselors as a National Certified Counselor which requires passing a competency exam + verification of academic and internship experience.

                <h2>What is therapy like with me?</h2>
                <p>
                    One part understanding, one part education, and one part action (that’s your part) with a healthy dose of humor and banter on top! The good, the bad, the ugly (or challenging) …bring it. Life is hard and a great laugh is often the reset of medicine we need. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therapy does not have to be devoid of personality. As a consumer I had experiences where I did not feel seen, heard, or understood. Know this. While change or relief can be difficult…it is possible.
