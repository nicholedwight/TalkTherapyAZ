                <h1>Personal Injury</h1>
                <p>
                    During the first quarter of 2021 I was involved in a car accident. My vehicle was hit from behind on my way home from work at a high rate of speed by a distracted driver. The experience left my mind with emotions from fear to anger to disappointment while anxiety + hypervigilance arrived & lingered thereafter. With my mind scared, my body was simultaneously attempting to heal from whiplash, hearing loss, and soft tissue damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result, I now dedicate a portion of my practice to providing assessment, therapy (counseling), and providing assessment results + documentation to primary providers in efforts to support your coordination of care. I accept direct inquiry, medical provider, or attorney of record referrals to ensure you get quality therapy services. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal Injury cases are <span class="underline">done via lien</span> and treatment is centered around injury from accident.  Treatment is <span class="underline">brief in nature</span> with the goal of pre-accident function not withstanding prior mental health challenges. 
                </p>

                <h2>Do you require my services?</h2>
                <p>
                    Things to consider:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Has your mood changed since the accident?</li>
                    <li>Do you find yourself on-guard or more easily startled since the accident? </li>
                    <li>Are you struggling to manage injuries sustained because of the accident? </li>
                    <li>Do you find navigating the process (injury, claim, multiple providers) overly stressful or upsetting and need help processing it?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Accidents happen. So does support & validation for your experience. Your feelings, thoughts, and emotions after a no-fault accident often benefit from talking about it in a safe space.
