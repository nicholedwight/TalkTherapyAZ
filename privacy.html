                <p>
                    I have experience with the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Adjustment Challenges</strong> <span class="italic">(Life / Relocation / Career / Sexuality / Identity / Marriage or Divorce):</span> “An emotional or behavioral reaction to a stressful event or change in a person's life.” (John Hopkins Medical Center, 2021)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Anxiety:</strong> “Everyone worries or feels nervous from time to time. Anxiety is a normal human reaction to stressful situations. But for people with anxiety disorders, those fears and worries are not temporary. Their anxiety persists and can even get worse over time. Anxiety disorders can severely impair a person’s ability to function at work, school, and in social situations. Anxiety can also interfere with a person’s relationships with family members and friends.” (American Psychological Association, 2016).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Depression:</strong> “It is important to realize that feeling down at times is a normal part of life. Sad and upsetting events happen to everyone. But, if you are feeling down or hopeless on a regular basis, you could be dealing with depression. Depression is considered a serious medical condition that can get worse without proper treatment. Those who seek treatment often see improvements in symptoms in just a few weeks.” (Healthline.com, 2021)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>LGBTQIA:</strong> I am a member of the community and an advocate for all in it. “Gender Affirming Therapy is a therapeutic stance that focuses on affirming a patient’s gender identity and does not try to repair it.” (Psychiatry.org, 2021) Core Interventions for this work includes: Space for processing and understanding, referrals to legal services and health care providers, sustaining a brave/safe space, embracing diversity, and reflection + empathy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Substance Use Disorder / Co-Occurring:</strong> “A complex condition in which there is uncontrolled use of a substance (alcohol, licit or illicit drugs) despite harmful consequences with or without a co-occurring mental health condition.” (American Psychiatric Association, 2021)
                </p>
                <h2>Conditions I Do Not Treat (referrals available):</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eating Disorders (Active)</li>
                    <li>Gambling or Gaming Disorder</li>
                    <li>Severe & Persistent Mental Illness (SMI)<strong><span class="italic">*</span></strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong><span class="italic">*</span></strong> I will consider seeing SMI clients with medication managed conditions on a case-by-case basis provided you have a current prescriber and agree to coordination of care as a condition of services (of course, only when clinically indicated as appropriate).

                    The law protects the relationship between a client and a therapist. Information cannot be disclosed without written permission.

                    As a mandated reporter in Arizona the following exceptions include:

                <ul>
                    <li>Suspected child abuse or dependent adult or elder abuse, is required to be reported to the appropriate authorities immediately.</li>
                    <li>If a client is threatening serious bodily harm to another person/s, I must notify the police and inform the intended victim.</li>
                    <li>If a client intends to harm himself or herself or themself, I make efforts towards safety planning. Absent of engagement or willingness, I must act with or without permission as provided by law to ensure your safety. </li>
